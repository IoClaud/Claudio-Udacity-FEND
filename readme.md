## Getting Started

This is my work for the project of the Portfolio of the Udacity Nanodegree Front-End program

### Prerequisites

I used the css flexible boxes, so for a correct view you must have this minimum version of the browser:
[css flexbox](https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox)
i.e. 11 or next
edge 16 or next
firefox 58 or next
chrome 64 or next
safari 11 or next

### Installing

It is not necessary to install any software besides the normal browser used for regular surfing on the internet.
To see the project simply download all the files, enter the downloaded folder on your PC, select the file index.html and double-click with the left mouse button.
